# Solving-ODEs-PDEs-Using-Neural-Network
This project solves ODEs or PDEs using neural network aprroach. The main idea of solving differential equation is to convert it to an optimization problem and use neural network. The first method for solving ODEs and PDEs using NN was developed by I. E. Lagaris and Fotiadis [1997] and then the method is improved in many papers. <br> 
There is another clear and well written paper by Maziar Raissi and Karniadakis [2017]. In addition a neural network framework was developed by Lau and Werth [2020] using Python and TensorFlow
